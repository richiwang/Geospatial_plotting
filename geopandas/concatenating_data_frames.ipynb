    "Concatenating data is a common GIS operations.  It just refers to the act of combining multiple data sources.  Usually these data sources have a common structure (i.e. the same attributes and geometry type).  An example might be if you are collecting data in the field using a mobile GPS device.  Every day the data that you collect is downloaded as a shapefile.  After a week you have 5 shapefiles with similar data and each of those must be combined into a masterfile that contains all of the data.\n",
