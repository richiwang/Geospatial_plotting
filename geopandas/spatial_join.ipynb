    "\n",
    "We have seen previously that GeoPandas allows us to use a spatial predicate in many places where a logical expression based on attribute values are called for. The same applies to join operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the raptor nest table and the county table.  If we had the name of the county in the raptor nest table we could join the county table to the raptor table on the base of the county name attribute.  We do not have the county name in the raptor table however.  What we have is the geometry of both the raptor nest and the county so we can join the two tables on the basis of the spatial relationship rather than an attribute relationship."
