# Geospatial_plotting
Examples for geospatial Data-Analysis ( in the geopandas folder) and map creations with folium and bokeh. 

The bokeh example originates from a Medium article ( https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-an-interactive-geographical-map-using-python-f4c5197e23e0 ) 
You will see that the bokeh example is very sophisticated and requires time to get behind, but it is beautiful. 

The Folium example and the dataset BW_Agrarstruktur was prepared by me (pre-GPT era =D ) for the "Landwirtschaftliches Hauptfest 2022".
